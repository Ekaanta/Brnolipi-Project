Bornolipi: AR-Based Child Learning App

Overview

Bornolipi is an innovative augmented reality (AR) application designed to provide a fun and interactive learning experience for children. It integrates AR technology with educational content in Bengali, English, and Arabic to engage children aged 3 and above. The app uses a combination of digital content and physical learning materials to create an immersive educational journey.

Features

Multilingual Support: Covers Bengali, English, and Arabic alphabets.

Augmented Reality Integration: Offers interactive 3D visualizations and animations.

Interactive Games: Includes educational games to make learning fun and effective.

Offline Accessibility: Ensures usability even without internet access.

Parental Tracking: Tracks and monitors the child’s learning progress.

Technology Stack

Frontend:

Framework: Unity 
Backend:

Firebase (for real-time database and user authentication).

AR Technology:

ARCore (for Android devices).

Vuforia (for AR marker-based scanning).

Database:

Firebase Realtime Database (for storing progress data).

Design Tools:

Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop (for UI/UX design).

Blender (for 3D modeling).

Development Process
